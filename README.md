# Authentication Project Description:

Our goal is to develop a robust authentication module that enables users to securely access our application. This module provides user registration, login, and authentication functionalities, ensuring that only authorized users can access protected resources.

**User Functionality:**

**1. Register:** Users can create new accounts by providing necessary details such as username, email, and password.

**2. Login:** Registered users can securely log in to their accounts using their credentials.

**3. Authentication:** Upon login, users are authenticated based on their provided credentials, granting access to protected resources.

## Technical Requirements:
To ensure a secure and reliable authentication system, the development must adhere to these guidelines:

**Backend Design:** Design the backend architecture to handle user registration, login, and authentication processes efficiently.

**Technology Stack:** Utilize the latest .NET versions, like .NET 6 or .NET 7, to leverage advanced features and security enhancements.

**Token-based Authentication:** Implement token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to securely authenticate users and manage user sessions.

**Password Hashing:** Hash user passwords using secure hashing algorithms to protect user credentials stored in the database.

**Validation and Exception Handling:** Implement comprehensive input validation to prevent injection attacks and robust exception handling to provide a smooth user experience.

**Authorization:** Implement role-based authorization to control access to different parts of the application based on user roles and permissions.

**Code Quality:** Maintain high code quality standards by following best practices and adhering to coding conventions.

**Swagger Documentation:** Provide comprehensive Swagger documentation for all authentication-related API endpoints to aid developers in understanding and utilizing the authentication system effectively.
